# Bounce

## By Dennis Yatunin and Daisy Barbanel

A physics simulation in which a bunch of balls are bouncing around in a perfect
vacuum, undergoing repeated perfectly elastic collisions. The mass of each ball
is directly proportional to the square of its radius. Balls can be dragged
the screen, either with a mouse or with a touchscreen. Everything (of course)
scales well with different screen resolutions.
